# High-Performance-Task-Scheduler
## Overview
This project is a multi-threaded task scheduler that executes tasks efficiently using priority-based scheduling. It optimizes CPU usage and reduces execution time compared to sequential task execution.

## Features (Planned)
- Multi-threaded task execution
- Priority-based scheduling
- Efficient CPU resource management
- Performance benchmarking

## Progress
- [ ] Task structure implementation
- [ ] Task queue setup
- [ ] Multi-threaded execution
- [ ] Performance testing
